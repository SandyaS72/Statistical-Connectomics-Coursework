This directory contains:
- a pdf file illustrating a possible assignment for Z, \rho(Z), and B(z) for the Bock11 paper, for use in a statistical decision theoretic
- the LaTeX and derivative files which created the pdf

The purpose of the enclosed is to design a possible sample space, and how we can map that sample space to an SBM model of data collected in the Bock11 paper to observe possible correlation between preferred orientation angle of V1 neuron, and the strength/collection of excita/inhibitory synapses it forms.
