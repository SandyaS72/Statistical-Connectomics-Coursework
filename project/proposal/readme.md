The proposal you create MUST follow the prescribed template (as seen in gkiar_proposal.pdf). This format follows the OCARF style, with your posed statistic decision theoretic written out in full at the end.

If you have references, you may include them at the bottom (if in latex, use bibtex)

This is due on Thursday Apr 2nd, 15h00 (i.e. before class).
