Read my email for a description of what to do... :)


"... by Tuesday (3/3) ...." 

"Write down a statistic decision theoretic for finding the mean human connectome. Please submit a pdf to greg (in the repo folder called 'mean_connectome'). We kind of did this in class today, if you weren't there then I'm sure someone will be willing to clarify/help/collaborate."
